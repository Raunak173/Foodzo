This website is basically a social media for all the foodies. User can register themselves on the app and then login to view and add their food pics. They can like each other's pics and comment on each other's post. Thanks too **diqus** comment section library. Users also have the liberty to view their dashboard. Dashboard enables them to edit or delete their pics. The app also consists of pagination too. It is a full too fun social media app for all the foodies there.
